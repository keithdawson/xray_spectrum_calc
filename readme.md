> Blake's mild fork of spekpy

Originally made with some Vibe Coding and trying to make an Xray Attenuation/Filter Flourescence Calculator. Realized that SpekPy already did some of this.

## SpekPy

- [SpekPy](https://bitbucket.org/spekpy/spekpy_release/wiki/Home) - Xray Spectrum Generator with multi filter calculators (Does not inclue flourescence generated by filters)


## Folder Structure/Specific Sub-scripts

- [pyne_edpl] Folder with the .py file for extracting data from the EFFED up EDPL files as .txt from LLNL. Also includes the exctracted CSVs from the Z0##.txt files. Should use the files from it as inputs to the 'main' program.
- [extract_atten_coeff] Folder with the script to pull the attenuation coefficients out of the z##.html files from NIST. Used for filters as with spekpy and density measurements.
- [make_xray_input_curve] Folder with the .py file for finishing an input csv curve and extrapolating linearly between missing values.
- [physics.nist.gov] Folder with the html folder structure/offline download from NIST with all the attenuation coefficients and other data (includes materials like Air, but didn't worry about it in any of my stuff).

## Main program (apply_filter_and_flourescence.py)

Originally intended to be a 'take in input curve', mess with it (based on a filter with specific properties), then output a new 'input curve' to be fed back into the same program which would then take a new filter.
Need to reconsider with data from Spekpy

- [attenuation_coefficients_long.csv] CSV with file from extract_atten_coeff.
- [plot_csv.py] Python script to plot curve from csv file with kV in first column, and relative intensity (any value) in the second.


I have no strong feelings on these.
 I have some of the things that didn't work saved in subfolders.
